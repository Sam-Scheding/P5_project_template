# P5 Project Template

## Description

This repository bundles a basic P5.js sketch with Parcel. This allows P5 to be installed via NPM, rather than referencing it in a script tag explicitly, and allows P5 sketches to use ES6 syntax, and be served with a hot reloader.

## Installation

```bash

$ npm install

# or

$ yarn install

```

## Running The Server

```bash

$ parcel index.html

```

By default this will serve the project at http://localhost:1234
